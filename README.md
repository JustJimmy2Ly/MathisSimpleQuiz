<h1>Math Quiz with Python and Voice</h1>
<p>I made a program that hears my answer to a random question from one of the following categories: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
If I got the question right, I earn a point. If I don't, It will show me the correct and deduct the point off.</p>
